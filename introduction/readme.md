# Introduction
* A block on a blockchain can be thought of much like a page in a notebook. Data is stored on a block, just like data is written on a page of a notebook.
* Each block is chained or tied to the previous block by embedding the block with information from the previous block
* If the data is tampered with anywhere in the chain, the links will break in a very obvious way. So, this makes a blockchain immutable.
* Components of blockchain:
   - Ledger: A distributed, immutable historical record
   - Peer Network: Stores, updates, and maintains the ledger
   - Membership Services: User authentication, authorization, and identity management
   - Smart Contract: Program that runs on the blockchain
   - Wallet: Stores users' credentials
   - Events: Notifications of updates and actions on the blockchain
   - Systems Management: Component creation, modification, and monitoring
   - Systems Integration: Integration of blockchain with external systems.
  
* History of Ledgers:
   - Single Entry 
   - Double Entry
   - Triple Entry(Blockchain)
       - Triple-entry accounting is an enhancement to the traditional double-entry system, in which all accounting entries involving outside parties are cryptographically sealed by a third entry.
