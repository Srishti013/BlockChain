# Blockchain Security

* The traditional computing environment is a company network fully or, at least mostly, under the control of the company's computer security staff. While many organizations are making the shift to cloud-based environments, they still have a high degree of control over the security and configuration of their rented systems. Traditional networks are highly centralized, and the focus of cybersecurity on these systems is primarily perimeter-focused. All systems and authorized users on the network are trusted or semi-trusted, so the focus is on preventing attackers from entering from outside the network.

* Blockchain is designed to be a decentralized, distributed system running on untrusted hardware. While security in traditional environments is designed to provide security by putting all data in one place and building walls around it, security in blockchain is based on ensuring that data is protected from modification by copying data to as many locations as possible to make modification of all copies infeasible. Traditional infrastructure focuses on confidentiality and integrity, while blockchain is designed to provide integrity and availability.

### Public and private blockchain
* A public blockchain network is completely open and anyone can join and participate in the network.
* A private blockchain network requires an invitation, and must be validated by either the network starter or by a set of rules. Private blockchains are usually set up as permissioned networks, placing restrictions on who is allowed to participate in the network, and only in certain transactions.
