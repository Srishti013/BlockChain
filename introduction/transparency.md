# Transparency
### Transparency of Traditional Databases
* They used CRUD(Create, Read, Upadate, Delete) technique.
* The CRUD update model of databases allows data to be changed or removed from the database. This means that the visible data in a database 
  is not an accurate historical record of the database. The existence of an Update operation means that each value in the database is only the most recent 
  version of that value and could have had different values in the past. The Delete operation means that values can be removed from the database.
### Blockchain Updates
The blockchain is designed to be a data structure that only allows appending:
* The past history of the blockchain is visible and immutable.
* Updates to the blockchain can be performed by including them in new blocks added to the blockchain.
